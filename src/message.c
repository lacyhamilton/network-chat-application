/*
  similarly, you need to have a structure in place that represents messages. 
  Messages have a type and other information, i.e. chat_node information and 
  text that represents a NOTE. Here, you will also have code in place that 
  handles messages, like sending and receiving them. Again, this code needs 
  to be OUTLINED.
